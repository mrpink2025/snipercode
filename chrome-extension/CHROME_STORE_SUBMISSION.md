| `storage` | Save user preferences and monitoring state | **Essential** - Store user settings locally (monitoring on/off, last sync time) |

## 🎯 Review Response Strategy

### Expected Questions from Reviewers

#### Q1: "Why does this extension need access to all websites?"
**Response**:
```
CorpMonitor is an enterprise security tool equivalent to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or Symantec DLP. 

Host permissions (<all_urls>) are required to:
1. Detect phishing sites and malware
2. Monitor for data exfiltration attempts
3. Enforce corporate security policies
4. Comply with LGPD/SOX/HIPAA audit requirements

This is standard for enterprise security extensions. Similar permissions are used by:
- Microsoft Defender Browser Protection
- Cisco Umbrella Browser Extension
- Zscaler Client Connector

The extension is designed for corporate deployment on company-managed devices via GPO.
```

#### Q2: "Why do you need cookies and tabs permissions?"
**Response**:
```
Cookies Permission:
- Essential for Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Detect potential credential leaks
- Monitor unauthorized authentication token usage
- Industry standard for corporate security tools

Tabs Permission:
- Required for compliance auditing (LGPD, SOX, HIPAA)
- Track navigation for forensic investigation
- Detect malicious redirects and phishing attempts
- Generate audit logs for regulatory requirements

These permissions enable core security functionality and are transparent to users via our public privacy policy.
```

#### Q3: "Is this spyware or employee monitoring software?"
**Response**:
```
No, this is a legitimate corporate security tool, not spyware.

Key differences:
✅ Transparent: Public privacy policy with full disclosure
✅ Legal basis: LGPD Art. 7, IX (Legitimate Interest)
✅ User notification: Users are clearly informed
✅ User control: Can pause monitoring
✅ Corporate use: Deployed on company devices, not personal devices
✅ Security focus: Prevent data breaches, not spy on employees

Equivalent to enterprise security tools by Microsoft, Symantec, Cisco, and Zscaler.

Purpose: Protect corporate data from:
- Phishing attacks
- Malware infections
- Data exfiltration
- Regulatory non-compliance
```

#### Q4: "What data do you collect and how is it used?"
**Response**:
```
Data Collected (fully disclosed in privacy policy):
1. Cookie metadata (names, domains) - NOT actual values
2. Navigation URLs and timestamps
3. Form structure (field names) - NOT form data
4. LocalStorage/SessionStorage keys - NOT values
5. Tab activity and page titles

NOT Collected:
❌ Passwords or payment info
❌ Personal messages/emails
❌ File contents
❌ Banking credentials

Purpose:
- Detect security threats (phishing, malware)
- Prevent data breaches
- Comply with regulations (LGPD, SOX, HIPAA)
- Forensic investigation of incidents

All data encrypted in transit/at rest. Access restricted to authorized IT security personnel.

Privacy Policy: https://monitorcorporativo.com/privacy-policy.html
```

#### Q5: "How do users consent to this monitoring?"
**Response**:
```
Consent Model:
1. Extension displays clear notification on first use
2. Privacy policy link in popup and options page
3. User can pause monitoring via toggle switch
4. Deployed on corporate-managed devices (implied consent via employment agreement)

Legal Basis:
- LGPD Art. 7, IX: Legitimate Interest (corporate security)
- Employment agreements include IT security policies

This is standard practice for enterprise security tools. Users on corporate devices understand their activity may be monitored for security purposes.
