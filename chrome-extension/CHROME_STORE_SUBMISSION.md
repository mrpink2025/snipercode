## üéØ Review Response Strategy

### Common Review Questions & Prepared Responses

#### Q: "Why do you need activeTab permission?"
**Response**: 
```
The activeTab permission is used exclusively to display statistics about the current 
page in the extension popup when the user clicks the extension icon. This allows 
users to see what data is being monitored on the current page, promoting transparency. 
The permission is not used for background monitoring or data collection across multiple 
tabs. Users must explicitly click the extension icon to activate this functionality.
```

#### Q: "What data do you collect?"
**Response**:
```
The Store version (v1.0.0) collects minimal data:
- Extension state (monitoring enabled/disabled)
- User preferences and settings
- Last report timestamp

All data is stored locally using the storage permission. No external data 
transmission occurs in the Store version. Our full privacy policy is publicly 
accessible at: https://monitorcorporativo.com/privacy-policy.html

Note: Enterprise customers receive a full-featured version via Group Policy 
deployment with explicit user notification and consent.
```

#### Q: "How do you justify corporate monitoring?"
**Response**:
```
CorpMonitor is designed for legitimate corporate security and compliance monitoring 
with full transparency:

1. LEGAL BASIS: Complies with LGPD (Brazilian data protection law) Article 7, IX 
   (legitimate interest) for corporate security

2. TRANSPARENCY: Users are fully informed through:
   - Clear privacy policy accessible in extension
   - On-screen notifications when monitoring is active
   - Ability to pause monitoring at any time

3. CORPORATE USE: Deployed only on company-owned devices with:
   - Proper employee notification
   - Signed acceptable use policies
   - Limited to work-related activities

4. NO ABUSE: Built-in safeguards prevent misuse:
   - Role-based access controls
   - Audit trails of all administrative actions
   - No collection of sensitive personal data (passwords, financial info)
   - Encrypted data storage and transmission
```

#### Q: "Your extension monitors users. Explain the use case."
**Response**:
```
CorpMonitor serves critical corporate security and compliance needs:

USE CASES:
1. Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Detect unauthorized data transfers
2. Compliance Monitoring: Ensure adherence to industry regulations (LGPD, SOX, HIPAA)
3. Security Incident Response: Investigate suspicious activities
4. Productivity Analytics: Understand workflow patterns (aggregated, anonymized)
5. Insider Threat Detection: Identify anomalous behavior patterns

TRANSPARENCY & CONSENT:
- Users receive explicit notification upon installation
- Privacy policy clearly outlines all data collection
- Monitoring indicator always visible
- Users can pause monitoring
- Data access strictly controlled by role-based permissions

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE:
- Deployed via IT-controlled Group Policy
- Used on company-owned devices only
- Part of comprehensive security program
- Regular privacy impact assessments
- Employee training on monitoring policies

This is a legitimate enterprise security tool, not a consumer app. It's comparable 
to other corporate security solutions like Symantec DLP, Microsoft Defender, or 
Proofpoint Enterprise.

## üîÑ Two-Version Strategy Explanation

### For Chrome Web Store Reviewers

**Important**: If asked about our two-version approach:

```
CorpWatch uses a "freemium" model tailored for enterprise security:

STORE VERSION (v1.0.0 - This Submission):
- Limited permissions (activeTab, storage)
- Basic functionality for evaluation
- Allows organizations to test the extension
- Suitable for Chrome Web Store distribution
- No sensitive monitoring capabilities

ENTERPRISE VERSION (v2.0.0+):
- Full monitoring capabilities
- Deployed via Group Policy (GPO) to corporate devices
- Bypasses store for corporate environments
- Includes comprehensive monitoring with full disclosure
- Subject to corporate IT governance

This approach:
1. Allows public evaluation via Chrome Web Store
2. Provides full control to enterprise IT administrators
3. Ensures compliance with store policies (limited permissions)
4. Enables corporate deployment with appropriate safeguards

Similar models are used by enterprise tools like:
- Microsoft Defender Browser Protection
- Cisco Umbrella Chromebook Extension
- Zscaler Client Connector
```
